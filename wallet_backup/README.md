# crypto wallet backup applet

To use:

- Make a directory, e.g. Bitcoin
- Put whatever you want to backup in that directory.
- Put package.sh and unpackage.sh in the parent directory, e.g. in ~/Wallets if ~/Wallets/Bitcoin, ~/Wallets/Ethereum
- Run ./package.sh to zip and encrypt these folders. Run ./unpackage.sh to unencrypt and unzip them.
- Remember to backup your keys. I use paperkey and qrencode to generate an encoded qr code that I printed out on a piece of paper and stuck in my safe.
